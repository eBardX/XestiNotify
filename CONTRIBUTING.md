#### Get Involved

There are many ways to contribute to XestiNotify. Here are a few ideas:

* Look through the [open

#### Opening a Pull Request

So you’ve decided to contribute code back upstream by opening a pull request.
You’ve invested a good chunk of time and we appreciate it. We’ll do our best to
work with you and get the PR looked at.

To help speed up the process, please make sure all the following are done when
submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/eBardX/XestiNotify) and create
   your branch from `master`.
2. Add the copyright notice to the top of any new files you’ve added. (Try to
   match the format in other files. For example, the created date is in ISO
   format. The copyright year should be the current year.)
3. Make sure to write unit tests for your changes!
4. Ensure that your changes are well documented as we strive to maintain 100%
   documentation coverage of all public interfaces.
5. Where possible, add a demo of the new feature to our example apps.
6. Reference the issue number in the pull request description.

#### Reporting a New Issue

When creating a new issue, always make sure to fill out the [issue
template](https://github.com/eBardX/XestiNotify/blob/master/.github/issue_template.md).
**This step is very important!**

Not doing so may result in your issue getting closed. Don’t take it personally
if this happens. Feel free to open a new issue once you’ve gathered all the
information required by the template.

* One issue, one bug: Please report a single bug per issue.
* Provide reproduction steps: List all steps neccessary to reproduce the issue.
* Mention the platform you are using (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS).
* Try out the latest version of XestiNotify. The bug may be fixed already.
